    "# EE 467 Lab 2: Breaking CAPTCHAs with Tensorflow / Keras\n",
    "In lab 2, we are going to work on automatically breaking CAPTCHAs with deep learning! Originally, CAPTCHA stands for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\", and traditional CAPCTHAs serve as a great tool to stop spam bots and malicious crawlers. Today, as we have made huge progress in computer vision and deep learning, these CAPCTHAs are no longer unbreakable by computers. Now let's prove the correctness of the claim by ourselves!\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, please check if the helper library, `lab_2_helpers.py` and the extracted dataset directory, `captcha-images` exist under the same directory. Then, please install all libraries used for this lab:"

    "## Bounding Box Extraction\n",
    "It's now time to perform the most important feature extraction step: finding contours and extracting characters. Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. It is useful for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. For our task however, we are **more interested in the bounding boxes around characters**, since these are the part of images we will be used for character classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "![char-contours.png](attachment:char-contours.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we are going to perform:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find contours around characters in CAPTCHAs.\n",
    "* Get the position and size for each corresponding bounding box.\n",
    "* If a bounding box is too wide (width-to-height ratio larger than 1.25), chances are that we have bounded two letters in a single bounding box. In this case, split the bounding box vertically from the center into two.\n",
    "* Store all bounding boxes for the CAPTCHA.\n",
    "* If there aren't 4 bounding boxes for the CAPTCHA, ignore it since our character extraction process must have run into problems in this case.\n",
    "* Sort the bounding boxes by their X coordinates, so that they match the order corresponding letters occur.\n",
    "* For each bounding box, extract corresponding region of the image, and store it as an instance of corresponding character at `${CHAR_IMAGE_FOLDER}/{letter}/{count}.png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these steps, we have transformed CAPTCHA images into images of single character. This simplifies our task since now our model only needs to deal with classification (from character image to character itself) rather than also dealing with detection (finding and extracting charatcers)."
